# Perovskite Solar Cell Performance Prediction

## Introduction

This project presents four neural network models in MATLAB designed to predict four key performance metrics of perovskite solar cells based on 31 input parameters. Perovskite solar cells are
at the forefront of photovoltaic research due to their high efficiency and low manufacturing costs. Accurate prediction of their performance can significantly accelerate development and optimization processes.

## Features

- **Prediction**: 
  - Open-Circuit Voltage (Voc)
  - Short-Circuit Current Density (Jsc)
  - Fill Factor (FF)
  - Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE)
- **Comprehensive Input Parameters**: Utilizes 31 features related to material properties, fabrication conditions, and device architecture.
- **User-Friendly Scripts**: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy to adapt and extend for related research.
